# Credit Card Fraud Detection using PySpark

This project implements a complete machine learning workflow for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **PySpark**.  
It is based on the well-known Kaggle dataset *“Credit Card Fraud Detection”*, which contains highly imbalanced data representing real-world fraud detection challenges.

The solution is developed using two separate Jupyter notebooks:

- **01_eda_and_preprocessing.ipynb** – exploratory data analysis and data cleaning  
- **02_modeling_and_evaluation.ipynb** – model training, prediction, and performance evaluation  

Both notebooks rely on **Spark MLlib** for scalable machine learning.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Load and explore the credit card dataset
- Perform data cleaning and type casting
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Assemble and scale features for MLlib models
- Train two machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - ROC–AUC  
  - F1-score  
  - Accuracy  
- Discuss the limitations caused by the high class imbalance

This project demonstrates how PySpark can be used effectively on medium-scale datasets while applying big-data machine learning pipelines.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **PySpark 3.x**
- **Spark MLlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Amazon Corretto JDK 11**

The dataset must be downloaded manually due to Kaggle licensing restrictions.
